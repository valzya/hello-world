I graduated Oklahoma State University in Stillwater with a Bachelors of Science degree in Marketing. 
 
I graduated Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology with an Associates of Science degree in Graphic Design Technology. 
 
Immediately upon graduating, I moved to Bentonville, Arkansas to work at the Wal-Mart home office.
 
Later while working at The Oklahoman, I helped jumpstart a magazine called Central Oklahoma Homes. My career progressed into refreshing my skills in web design and development. I began taking a Web Design II night course at Oklahoma City Community College studying html, CSS, javascript and PHP. Then, I also completed a semester of web design and development at Francis Tuttle Technology Center. 
 
My last position was working as an Apple Pro at Simply Mac. Shortly before that I worked as an eMedia Designer II at Walmart in the Global People Center. Previously, I have worked in the retail, telecommunications, automotive and insurance industries. I have also owned my own business, Valmedia, LLC, working with design and website business clients. 
 
My Software skills include: Adobe InDesign / Adobe Illustrator / Adobe Photoshop / Adobe Dreamweaver / CSS / html / xhtml / Wordpress, with some experience in Javascript / PHP / C# / Visual Studio / github
 
I also enjoy doing ink, acrylic paint and pastel fine art on the side.
